3	where did the #2 pencil come from?  where's #1 and #3? there's a #1 and a #3, but #2, as the compromise candidate, is by far the most common.\n\n#1 pencils have a harder lead, meaning a lighter color and finer line. Also, they don't wear down as quickly. On the other hand #3 have a softer lead, giving a thicker, darker line and quick wear that requires frequent sharpening. there are even some numbers beyond that but you are only likely to find them in specialty stores, such as art supply.

The factories themselves are modern assembly lines. \n\nGenerally product development costs are not high since there is little new product development and most products are based on known, or copied, designs. China has been the most successful country is terms of ""duplicating"" other countries designs with almost comparably quality (although usually slightly inferior) at a lower cost basis."

The measured distance from tip to tip of the crest of the waves is what makes it considered a 'micro' wave.\n\nMicrowaves are a shorter wavelength than the electromagnetic waves that carry radio signals, but longer than those waves that our eyes can detect in the 'visible' spectrum.\n\nNASA has a very good explanation of them at the Web site below:

There is breif disappointment when the clock hits 6 or 7 (depending on the establishment), but I just stick around and wait for Reverse Happy Hour (who ever came up with that is brilliant) and my happiness is restored.  For real ... what is there to not like about happy hour (another question in itself).

I mean it's a good food, but if it's unappealing to you then there's no reason you should force yourself to eat it.\n\nThe best way to overcome it would be just to eat it.

9	why is there a fight between israel & palestine? because their value systems are completely different.\n\nno arab countries have yet adopted a modern position that includes the rule of law, equal rights, and the rights of the individual over the rights of the state.  Israel embodies those principles unquestionably.  Thus the conflict.\n\nunfortunately for the arabs, the rest of the world is moving away from the middle age mentality in which tens or hundreds of millions of arabs live.  Therefore you will not see an end to the conflict in your lifetime.	
9	Do you think it was time Bush called back out troops? Yes. But that would be irresponsible leadership. A president should be able to stay the course especially when comes to war.

4	How would u find out whether a device is acting as a host or a router using an SNMP command? Mind you that many hosts (e.g. workstation, laptop) do have multiple network interfaces and could technically act as a router.\n\nIn that case if you are an authorized SNMP manager, you can try to view the machine's ipRouteTable (more on that see http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2096.html.)  The table's content would tell you if this machine is configured to route/forward IP packets, hence acting as a router.

If you are anemic, this is the best cookware to use and stay away from nonstick pans.  I got this info years ago when I was anemic but don't remember where it came from.  I also think the food comes out better.  The downside - it's very heavy.

9	Do we really need the draft?does the selective service need to be activated, or does america need to reduce troop deployment?Your question is comparing apples to oranges.\nThe draft is an emergency-only, time-of-desperate-need usage only option.  That we ONLY have the 'selective service' requirement, and that is only until you are 25 years old, is a great thing compared to other countries.

9	What are the things on soldiers helmets that look like they might be cameras?

While all AMD processors now support 64 bit processing, the Sempron processors are AMD's ""value"" line, run at somewhat lower clock speeds, and have less L2 cache on chip, making them much less expensive to manufacture while still providing very good performance.

If they intend to kill but misfire and hit someone below the waist, it is attempted murder.  Ironically, when it comes to murder itself as a crime intent is less important.  A person who does not intend to murder (i.e. aims below the waist) but nonetheless renders a fatal wound is guilty of murder so long as the person intended to shoot the gun.

If they don't find the Higgs, be ready for a whole pile of other particles.  I say mass comes from the same place as electric charge and color.

The first National Election that 18 year olds were able to vote in was in 1972 when Richard Nixon won a landslide victory over George McGovern.	
9	How are state capitals chosen? There's no set rule for picking a state capitol.\n\nMost capitols were set long ago, in a place central to a state.  This is because state representatives and officials had to ride, by horse and/or carriage, to the capital to conduct business.  I live in Michigan.  Lansing is out capital.\n\nWhile Detroit is our biggest and most popular city, it wouldn't be practicle for a representative to ride from, say, Marquette.  \n(This is actually a poor example because Detroit was the capital of Michigan before Lansing, but the point is the same.)
