0	this is truly a re - make that should never have gotten out of the stable . it has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata . at the top of their game are joan plowright and maximillian schell . every nuance of the franks is in plain sight . at the rock bottom are melissa gilbert and doris roberts . i can not imagine how schell and plowright manage to play so well when gilbert and roberts are working their anti - magic . gilbert ruins every scene she 's in . it 's like father knows

0	unlike some of the reviews written here , i did n't hate this movie . it is a movie that could have been much better than it was . not oscar material , true , but much better than it was.<br /><br />i thought the plot had a good hook and through line . granted , this movie was badly written . and terribly directed and produced . i mean , how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have ? why were we there ? what exactly is the point of the opening sequence ? it seems like the producer(s )

1	this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better . holmes is protecting an inventor in switzerland and is on the trail of professor moriarity , who has become a nazi . this is a better version of holmes in a wwii world . rathbone does a great job with holmes as a spy and a detective . see this if you liked the voice of terror .	
1	just like all of mel brooks ' other comedies , men in tights is hilarious . but in seeing this as an outrageous comedy , i think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well . elwes is the well - spoken former british noble , lewis is an eternally annoyed king ( i hope it 's worth all the nooooooiiiise ! ) , deluise is a fantastic godfather , roger rees is a worried and cynical sheriff .... the actors and actresses are so loyal to	
0	this documentary was boring , and quite stupid.<br /><br />i mean ... the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works ? it is a theory , and the name is just plain dumb . reading a college biology text - book could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is . darwinism is a good theory , but evil if it is done as politics.<br /><br />also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people ... no expert testimonies , and shady leads ... <br /><br />the documentary was also

0	aside from frank kress ( who played abraham gentry ) , an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie , there really was n't anything particularly good about this film . why it is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me -- the film is 99.44 % crap ... and exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis . in the 1960s and 70s , lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films , such as blood feast and monster a go - go	
1	this is a totally awesome movie ! if you have n't seen it yet , you damn well should . sure , the plot is slow to develop , the special effects are laughable , the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed , but as wrestler ddp would say ; that 's not a bad thing .... that 's a good thing ! everything about this movie is hilarious , especially if you get the dubbed version , which has even worse actors . it 's countless laughs until you get to the end , yearning for	
1	first , i rated this movie 10/10 . to me , it 's simply one of the best i saw since i was born ( i 'm 23 , but i saw numerous films ) . the story is cruel , but reality is , too , not ? it went deep into me and stirred my bowels . i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and i still remember it ! < br /><br />second , there is no ' national preference ' ( this expression is a direct translation from

0	this was an attempt toward a romantic comedy , and one which did not work . although the film was cast in an interesting manner , the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all . the director 's fey mannerisms may have succeeded if he had adopted a point of view . it was embarrassing to watch william baldwin and , in particular , armin muller - stahl .

0	this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen . it is a tight slap on the face of some indians who speak in english and were looking at the mirror . disgusting . the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north indian plains . the message - the educated english - speaking indian tried to save the poor beggars of india in all earnestness . it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.<br /><br />as a love story its okay

1	i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister . i was in grade 5 , and still a kid , and the drive closed down 4 years later , but the film still lingers in my memory . an adult movie , which a kid finds entertaining . that is a mark of excellence . hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors , and this film proves it . i like the billy put down the ice cream scene , and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself . remember joe flairty crying	
0	one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don`t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those amicus anthology movies . add the beast in the cellar to the list < br /><br />much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end . once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film . it does open with a fairly good hook but after that we`re treated to long boring sequences	
0	from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film . lets put it this way , i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought ' i can do better than that ! whilst sat watching this pap . the acting in this film was terrible , i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from aliens3 was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place .	
0	6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching , so let me redress the balance.<br /><br />if this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry . unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes i 'll never see again and hopefully i 'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own . < br /><br />whilst the idea behind the film is interesting , it is not developed enough to keep	
1	and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it was n't for the seriously uneven irish accent of barbara hershey in the leading role of mother madalyn . the accent came and went unfortunately which i found more than a little distracting . < br /><br />however , the performance of william l petersen in the role of joad was outstanding , he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue . captivating and genuine , i found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the

1	mr. bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy . he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit , a massive budget , a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant . and mr. bean is one of those characters who you just ca n't forget . some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes , they 're not realistic at all and they 're all pretty stupid , but to be honest , realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness

0	first , i am a big fan of alien and alien ii - in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the si - fi horror genre as we know it today . i noticed lifeforce was often compared to the aliens saga - after viewing this movie i would highly disagree . there are some okay special effects with the alien vampires , and the story line might have been acceptable . i just ca n't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie , this is absolutely absurd ( although she does look

0	ty cobb is , by far , the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live . his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics , brilliant strategy , and pure unadulterated violence . every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty . so of course , the film about him deals with none of that , instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump . now this is n't such a horrible idea in theory , as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and	
1	karim hussain 's masterpiece of art / gore -- this cat is definitely a talent to look out for . we have in this several longer vignettes interspliced with some shorter segues . this is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewers.<br /><br />the film kicks off with a short called ovarian eyeball . very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked . an unseen woman 's hand covers the supine woman 's face with a red cloth and	
1	"a great performance by clint eastwood and particularly john malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date . malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it 's incredible . eastwood is agent mike horrigan , an aged and cynical secret service agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments . but one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious . horrigan and his new partner al are sent to investigate a threat on the president by a "" wacko "" ."	
1	i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was . surpassing all the modern american efforts at slasher films.<br /><br />it as what all those films do n't . likable characters , genuine mystery , suspense , graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack.<br /><br />this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years . german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately . its a shame more people wo nt go to see such films because they are missing out . it is easily	
0	take your video camera , turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you 've got the basic idea of what this film looks like . it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie . to be fair , there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie . i like scary movies and creature features but this one just did n't do a thing for me . so sorry . i really tried to like it .	
0	i must admit , ashamed though i am , that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror - chiller was one of my favourite all time films . nine years after first viewing stephen king 's frightening story however i have now come to my senses , and am able to assess fritz kiersch 's work more reasonably.<br /><br />indeed king 's tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper , but it makes for a cheap , average

0	i seemed to find the trailers better than the movie . they did their job and made me interested in watching unknown . the interest waned early . a simple premise laking in scenery . five men wake up in a chemical warehouse not knowing why they are there ; let alone know how in the hell they got there . confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and distrust . the men learn that a kidnapper is on his way with plans to kill his hostages . now the men size each other up trying to distinguish if all

0	this movie is absurd . absolutely terrible . michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie . the plot is totally not believable ! michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective , but then escapes . he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital . he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital , blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge ( why ? ) .	
0	at least for me . i have been following the career of mr. almdovar since the beginning and i was not crazy about this film . i think penelope cruz was miscast , the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good , she makes the character unbelievable . also , the singing scene was just weird . i do not get the point and the lip - sync was awful.<br /><br />as spaniard , another thing that drove me nuts are the accents . why people coming from the same place have such a different accent
